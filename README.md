# Whistle-of-Freedom
The Whistle of Freedom enables you to access the most commonly used shortcuts using your whistle(or any vocal or instrumental for that matter). You could also configure this as a controller for that small game you wanted to play(Well, T-Rex Runner)

Usage:
Launch Config.py, and enter the shortcut you would like executed at the frequency specified, and save it.
Run Controller.py and let the magic begin.

Prerequisites:
Whistle of Freedom depends on Tkinter, PyAudio, NumPy, Wave, OS, modules in python, which can be easily installed using pip.
